📌 **Talk to Your Data – Natural Language to SQL Generator** 💬🗄️  

---

## 🔎 Project Overview  
This project explored **Text-to-SQL**, the task of converting everyday **natural language queries into SQL statements**.  
It bridges the gap between human communication and structured databases, making data access more **intuitive and accessible** for non-technical users.  

---

## ⚙️ Tech Stack & Setup  
- **Frameworks:** PyTorch / TensorFlow, Hugging Face Transformers  
- **Models:** Sequence-to-sequence (Encoder–Decoder, e.g., T5/BART)  
- **Database:** SQLite (sample schema for testing)  
- **Components:**  
  - Natural Language Understanding (NLU)  
  - Entity mapping to schema  
  - SQL generation and execution  

---

## 📊 Implementation Highlights  
1. **Intent Understanding** → Extracted user’s query meaning using NLU  
2. **Entity Mapping** → Mapped query terms to database schema (tables, columns)  
3. **SQL Generation** → Translated natural language into structured SQL queries  
4. **Execution & Output** → Ran queries on the database and displayed results in a user-friendly format  

---

## 🖼️ Observations & Results  
- The model successfully **translated simple queries** (e.g., “Show all employees in Sales”) into valid SQL  
- **Schema mapping** was critical to accuracy — without correct mapping, queries failed  
- Output formatting made query results **readable for non-technical users**  

---

## ✅ Key Takeaways  
- Text-to-SQL is **not just parsing**, it’s about **understanding intent + schema context**  
- With the right pipeline, database querying becomes as simple as a conversation  
- This opens up **data accessibility for non-technical stakeholders**  

---

## 🔮 Future Work  
- Extend to **complex queries** (nested SELECT, JOINs, aggregations)  
- Improve **entity linking** using advanced NLP methods  
- Integrate with a **frontend chatbot UI** for interactive querying  
- Explore **few-shot prompting** with large LLMs (e.g., GPT-4, LLaMA)
